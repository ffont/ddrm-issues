# Deckard's Dream DIY synthetizer (unofficial) issue tracker

This repository is intented to track issues with the [Deckard's Dream](http://deckardsdream.com/) DIY synthetizer (also applies to pre-built units). No code is expected to be here, just use Github's great issues system so we can have focussed discussions about specific problems and fixes for Deckard's Dream synth. At any point in time this repository can also be useful to easily share the issues we enountered with the designers of the synth.

To participate in the discussions you'll need to create a Github user, but that's all about it, you don't need to know about code or how to use git, simply navigate to the [issues](https://github.com/ffont/ddrm-issues/issues) and you'll find all information there.

Also make sure to check the [issues that have been already solved](https://github.com/ffont/ddrm-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before opening a new one.
