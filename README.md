# Deckard's Dream DIY synthetizer official issue and feature request tracker

This repository is intented to track issues and feature requests with the [Deckard's Dream](http://deckardsdream.com/) DIY synthetizer (also applies to pre-built units). No code is expected to be hosted here, just using Github's great *ticketing* system so we can have focussed discussions about specific problems and fixes for Deckard's Dream synth.

To participate in the discussions you'll need to create a Github user, but that's all about it, you don't need to know how to code or how to use git, simply navigate to the [issues](https://github.com/ffont/ddrm-issues/issues) section and you'll find all information there.

Also make sure to check the [issues that have been already solved](https://github.com/ffont/ddrm-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before opening a new one.
